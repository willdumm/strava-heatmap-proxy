# Note: Automatic credential update via workflow is not working anymore
Check back with upstream repo for fix. In the meantime, open the [global heatmap](https://www.strava.com/maps/global-heatmap?sport=All&style=standard&terrain=false&labels=true&poi=true&cPhotos=true&gColor=mobileblue&gOpacity=100#11/37.7792/-122.4194), log in, then open developer tools and refresh the page. In the network tab, there should be a request to `https://heatmap-external-a.strava.com/auth` (or `-b` or `-c`). Copy the entire value of the `Cookie` header, and set the cloudflare worker's `STRAVA_COOKIES` secret to this value. This will have to be done every two weeks.

# strava-heatmap-proxy

This is a simple [Cloudflare Worker](https://workers.dev) allowing
unauthenticated access to personal and global Strava heatmaps. If you want to
use your personal Strava heatmap in Gaia or Locus, this will give you a URL
that you can use for that.

Note: you **will** need to be a Strava premium subscriber to use the personal
heatmap, while the global heatmaps are available to all Strava accounts. Personal
use only, please. Strava will ratelimit you.

# Setup

Follow either of the two paths described below to deploy your Cloudflare
Worker.

If you want to use these heatmaps as a tile layer in another app, here are the
template URLs to use:

- Personal: `https://strava-heatmap-proxy.YOUR_NAMESPACE.workers.dev/personal/orange/all/{zoom}/{x}/{y}@2x.png`
- Global: `https://strava-heatmap-proxy.YOUR_NAMESPACE.workers.dev/global/orange/all/{zoom}/{x}/{y}@2x.png`

Check `https://strava-heatmap-proxy.YOUR_NAMESPACE.workers.dev/` for full list
of supported tile colors, activities, and sizes.

## The easy way

Start by forking this repository and setting up some GitHub secrets
(`github.com/you/strava-heatmap-proxy/settings/secrets/actions`).

- `STRAVA_EMAIL`
- `STRAVA_PASSWORD`
- [`CF_ACCOUNT_ID`](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/get-started/basic-tasks/find-account-and-zone-ids/)
- [`CF_API_TOKEN`](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/api/get-started/create-token/)

These secrets will be used by two GitHub Actions:

1. [deploy.yml](.github/workflows/deploy.yml): Deploy to Cloudflare on every
   commit to `main`.
2. [credentials.yml](.github/workflows/credentials.yml): Fetch fresh Strava
   cookies once per week.

Trigger both of these actions for your first deploy, and you should be good to
go. Your site should now be live on
`strava-heatmap-proxy.YOUR-NAMESPACE.workers.dev`.

## Manual

Requirements:

  - [wrangler](https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler) to manage Worker deployments
  - [deno](https://deno.land) to run Strava authentication script

Strava's API doesn't support this kind of access directly, so we'll need to
log in with an email and password and grab session cookies for
authentication.

This can either be done manually in the browser or via
`./scripts/refresh_strava_credentials.ts`

``` console
$ export STRAVA_EMAIL="my-strava-account@example.com"
$ export STRAVA_PASSWORD="hunter2"
$
$ ./scripts/refresh_strava_credentials.ts
STRAVA_ID=12345
STRAVA_COOKIES=...
```

Now that we have these values, let's store them as Worker secrets.

``` console
$ wrangler login
$ echo "1234" | wrangler secret put STRAVA_ID
$ echo "...." | wrangler secret put STRAVA_COOKIES
```

Check that everything's working by running `wrangler dev`.

Here's an example tile URL with some data:
[/global/mobileblue/all/11/351/817@2x.png](http://127.0.0.1:8787/global/mobileblue/all/11/351/817@2x.png)
(Downtown Los Angeles)

When you're all set, use `wrangler publish` to bring the site live on
`strava-heatmap-proxy.YOUR-NAMESPACE.workers.dev`

Heads up, your credentials will expire after a few weeks, considering creating
a periodic task to refresh them every 7 days or so.
